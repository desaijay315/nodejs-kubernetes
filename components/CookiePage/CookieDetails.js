                <p>
                A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letter and number) that is sent by a web server browser, and stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and to identify users returning to a website. Cookie may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. </p>
